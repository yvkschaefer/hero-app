## Some background:

I wanted to find a django tutorial with a REST API aspect to it. I went through two broken tutorials and finally stumbled on this one https://medium.com/@BennettGarner/build-your-first-rest-api-with-django-rest-framework-e394e39a482c

It's not perfect but I accomplished my goal with it âˆš

## To run:

outside directory:

create virtual environment, then

**$source env/bin/activate**


**$cd hero-app**


**$python manage.py runserver**


**$python manage.py migrate**
